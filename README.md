# A2

## Introduction
This contract is an extension of the [A2 standard](https://tzip.tezosagora.org/proposal/tzip-15/). It allows to manage permissions regarding asset
transfers on-chain.

## Set up
This whitelist contract is coded in [Archetype](https://docs.archetype-lang.org/).
To be able to run the tests, you need to install the [Completium CLI](https://completium.com/docs/cli):
```bash
> npm ci
> npm run completium_init
> npm run completium_add_users
> npm run mockup_init
> npm run test
```

To use the mockup mode, you need to have the `octez-client` installed. You can find instructions on how to do that here: https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/1-tezos-client/

## How it works
```plantuml
start
if (from in restricted list?) then (yes)
    #pink:error: FROM_RESTRICTED;
    kill
elseif (to in restricted list?) then (yes)
    #pink:error: TO_RESTRICTED;
    kill
elseif (is sender a super user ?) then (yes)
    #palegreen:transfer is valid;
    stop
elseif (is TO transfer list in FROM allowed lists ?) then (yes)
    #palegreen:transfer is valid;
    stop
else (no)
    #pink:error: TO_NOT_ALLOWED;
    kill

```

### Examples
Consider the following examples extracted from the A2 standard.

#### Users:
* `"alice": 0`
* `"bob": 0`
* `"charlie": 1`
* `"dan": 2`

#### Transferlists:

* `0: (unrestricted: True, allowedTransferlists: {0, 2})`
* `1: (unrestricted: True, allowedTransferlists: {1})`
* `2: (unrestricted: False, allowedTransferlists: {1, 2})`

Then suppose the following call to assertTransfers were made:
```
assertTransfers
{ Pair "alice" { "bob", "dan" }
, Pair "bob" { "alice" }
, Pair "charlie" { "charlie", "dan" }
}
```

* `alice -> bob`: alice and bob are on the same transferlist (`0`), which contains itself in its `allowedTransferlists` and is `unrestricted`, so this succeeds
* `alice -> dan`: alice is on a transferlist (`0`) that contains `dan's` transferlistId (`2`) in its `allowedTransferlists` and is `unrestricted`, but it fails because `dan`'s transferlist is restricted
* `bob -> alice`: This succeeds by the same logic as `alice -> bob`: they're on the same `unrestricted` transferlist that contains its own transferlistId in its `allowedTransferlists`
* `charlie -> charlie`: This succeeds since `charlie`'s transferlist is unrestricted and contains its own transferlistId in its `allowedTransferlists`
* `charlie -> dan`: This fails because `dan`'s transferlist (`2`) is restricted

Thus the above call to `assertTransfers` will fail.

#### Super user:
This implementation introduces a new feature: the `super user`. The `super user` has the ability to trigger a transfer between two addresses in whitelists
not allowed to transfer between each other.  When the transfer is triggered by a super user, we only verify that the user list is not restriced.
We do not verify the allowed transfer lists.
> **It will only work if the address is not in a restricted whitelist**

If we take back the data we used in the above example, and the following transfers:
```
assertTransfers triggered by super user
{ Pair "charlie" { "charlie" }
, Pair "alice" { "charlie" }
, Pair "bob" { "dan" }
, Pair "dan" { "charlie" }
}
```

* `charlie -> charlie`: `charlie` is in transferlist (`1`), which is `unrestricted`, so this **succeeds** since it is triggered by the super user.
* `alice -> charlie`: `alice` is on a transferlist (`0`) and `charlie` is in transferlist (`1`), both `unrestricted`, so this **succeeds**.
* `bob -> dan`: `bob` is on a transferlist (`0`) and `dan` is in transferlist (`2`) which is `restricted`, so this **fails**
* `dan -> charlie`: `bob` is on a transferlist (`0`) and `dan` is in transferlist (`2`) which is `restricted`, so this **fails**

## Model
```plantuml
map users {
 [USER] => [TRANSFER LIST]
 alice => 1
 bob => 2
}

object super_users {
 charly
}

map transfer_lists {
 [ID] => [UNRESTRICTED, ALLOWED_LISTS]
 1 => True, [0,1]
 2 => True, [1,2]
 3 => False, [2]
}
```
